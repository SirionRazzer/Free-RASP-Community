# About Us
Talsec is an academia-based and community-driven mobile security company. We deliver in-App Protection and a User Safety suite for Fintechs.

We realize a gap and the need in bridging solution between the user's perception of app safety and the high security requirements of the financial industry. 

Talsec freeRASP Community Edition provides a commercial-grade easy-to-integrate mobile security SDK that actively protects apps from attacks. SDK interacts with an on-line app security service that generates regular status reports, detects attacks and triggers watchdog notifications to app developers.

The Community Edition option is available for Android and iOS developers. We encourage community contributions, investigations of attack cases, joint data researches and other activities aiming to make bettera app security and app safety for end-users.

# Enterprise Services
We provide extended services (ie. malware detection) to our commercial customers with a self-hosted cloud platform as well. To get the most advanced protection compliant with PSD2 RT and eIDAS and support from our experts contact us at https://talsec.app.
